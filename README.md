# turning_math_problem_into_code

Is a mono repo for everything maths problem into coding to enhance our coding skills, especially for beginning trying to master Python or other programming language, most especially writing quality code logic, not cramming syntax.
We will have the math problem in .txt file, then we see the pseudocode and literal interpretation of the code, then we optimise it.

Note: 
Coding is a continuous learning journey. It is not once and stop, it is once and again!

The structured to building strong foundations in Programming Basics are listed below:
1. Focus on Core Concepts: Spend time deeply understanding basic programming concepts such as data types, variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.). These are the building blocks of code logic, and understanding them well will make complex problems easier to tackle.
2. Use your math background(if you have one!) to break down problems logically before you write code. Map out the steps you’d take to solve a problem mathematically, then translate each step into code. This approach can help bridge the gap between understanding the logic and implementing it in a programming language.
3. Then start with simple algorithms (e.g., sorting and searching algorithms, recursion, and basic mathematical algorithms). Writing small programs or functions that achieve specific goals can reinforce your understanding of how code logic flows.

Develop a Problem-Solving Framework
Having a "structured approach" to problem-solving can reduce overwhelm and increase confidence. Here’s a suggested framework:

1. Understand the Problem Fully: Carefully read the problem statement. Write down any observations, known inputs, and expected outputs. Clarify any doubts you may have before jumping into coding.
2. Break Down the Problem: Break the problem into smaller steps or subproblems. Solve each small part individually rather than tackling the entire problem at once.
3. Outline Your Solution (Pseudo-code): Write out the logic in plain language or pseudocode before translating it into actual code. This can help you focus on the logic without getting caught up in syntax.
4. Debug Incrementally: As you write the code, test it in parts. This “divide and conquer” approach helps isolate issues and keeps the task manageable.
Reflect and Improve: After solving the problem, take a moment to analyze what went well and what didn’t. This will help reinforce learning and prepare you for similar problems.

Note: When dealing with list, it can be a sorted list or unsorted list. Take note of it, when working with a list/array
