Michael scores a 95, 87, 85, 93, and a 94 on his first 5 math tests. If he wants a 90 average, what must he score on the final math test?
Options: 90,84,86,96, 88.

Pseudo code:
1. Sum up his 5 scores on the math test he has taken
2. Divide the sum by the total or not.
3. let x be his new_unknown_score, then we find the average / 6( where 6 is the len of this score)
