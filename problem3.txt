Problem: The Cooking Club made some pies to sell at
a basketball game to raise money for the
new math books. The cafeteria contributed
four pies to the sale. Each pie was then cut
into five pieces and sold. There were a total
of 60 pieces to sell. How many pies did the
club make?





Math solutiion to the problem
Apologies for the incomplete response. Let's continue and solve the problem step-by-step.

Given the information:

*   The cafeteria contributed 4 pies.
*   Each pie was cut into 5 pieces.
*   There were a total of 60 pieces available for sale.

Let's denote:

*   xxx as the number of pies made by the club.

### Steps to solve the problem:

1.  **Calculate total pieces contributed by the cafeteria:** The cafeteria contributed 4 pies, and each pie was cut into 5 pieces.
    
    Total pieces from cafeteria\=4×5\=20\\text{Total pieces from cafeteria} = 4 \\times 5 = 20Total pieces from cafeteria\=4×5\=20
2.  **Total pieces available for sale:** Including both cafeteria pies and club-made pies, there were 60 pieces available for sale.
    
    Total pieces\=Pieces from cafeteria+Pieces from club\=20+5x\\text{Total pieces} = \\text{Pieces from cafeteria} + \\text{Pieces from club} = 20 + 5xTotal pieces\=Pieces from cafeteria+Pieces from club\=20+5x
3.  **Set up the equation:** Since the total pieces available for sale is given as 60:
    
    20+5x\=6020 + 5x = 6020+5x\=60
4.  **Solve for xxx:**
    
    5x\=60−205x = 60 - 205x\=60−20 5x\=405x = 405x\=40 x\=405\=8x = \\frac{40}{5} = 8x\=540​\=8

 Conclusion:

The club made x\=8x = 8x\=8 pies.

### Verification:

*   Pies contributed by the cafeteria: 444 pies.
    
*   Pies made by the club: 888 pies.
    
*   Total pies: 4+8\=124 + 8 = 124+8\=12 pies.
    
*   Total pieces from cafeteria: 4×5\=204 \\times 5 = 204×5\=20 pieces.
    
*   Total pieces from club: 8×5\=408 \\times 5 = 408×5\=40 pieces.
    
*   Total pieces for sale: 20+40\=6020 + 40 = 6020+40\=60 pieces.
    

Therefore, the calculation is correct, and the club made 8\\boxed{8}8​ pies.
