Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Pseudo code
unique_character(the_string):
    Initialize an empty dictionary tracker

    for each character char in the_string:
        if char exists as a key in tracker:
            increment the value of tracker[char] by 1
        else:
            add char as a key in tracker with value 1

    return tracker
